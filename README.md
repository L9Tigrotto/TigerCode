# TigerCode: Custom Language Project

Welcome to TigerCode! This repository contains the source code and documentation for my ongoing effort to create a new programming language and provide tools for users to build their own grammars and languages. The project is in its early stages, with the ultimate goal of creating an executable file.

## Project Overview

The aim of TigerCode is twofold:
1. **Develop TigerCode Language**: Create a fully functional programming language from scratch.
2. **Empower Users**: Provide tools and frameworks for users to define their own grammars and build custom languages.

The process involves several key steps:

1. **Lexer Development**: The lexer, or lexical analyzer, is responsible for breaking down the source code into tokens. This is the first step in the compilation process.
2. **Parser Development**: The parser will use the tokens generated by the lexer to create a parse tree based on the grammar of the language. This step involves reading a grammar file written in BNF (Backus-Naur Form) or a custom format. A parse tree visualizer may be developed for better debugging.
3. **Code Generation**: Initially, the stack and the heap will be managed with a C# dictionary. In the future, the goal is to translate the parse tree into C code or assembly language directly.

## Current Progress
**Lexer Development**: I have just started working on the lexer. The initial implementation is underway, focusing on tokenizing basic language constructs.

## Future Goals
- **Complete Lexer**: Finish the lexer implementation to handle all language constructs.
- **Develop Parser**: Implement the parser to generate a parse tree from the tokens.
- **Code Generation**: Transition from managing stack and heap with a C# dictionary to generating C code or assembly language.
- **Parse Tree Visualizer**: Create a visualizer to aid in debugging the parse tree.
- **User Grammar Tools**: Develop tools that allow users to define and test their own grammars.
- **Documentation**: Enhance documentation to include detailed explanations and examples.
- **Testing**: Develop a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability of the language and user-defined grammars.

## Getting Started

### Create Your Own Grammar and Compile Projects

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TigerCode.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd TigerCode`
   - Alternatively, download it from NuGet packages in future implementations.

2. **Write Your Own Grammar**:
   - Define your grammar rules and save them in a file.
   - Pass this grammar file to the lexer.

3. **Write a Program**:
   - Create a program in your new language.
   - Provide this program to the parser for compilation.

### Compile TigerCode Files

1. **Download the TigerCode Compiler**:
   - Obtain the TigerCode compiler from the repository or future distribution channels.

2. **Execute the Compiler**:
   - Run the compiler, passing your TigerCode file(s) as arguments.
